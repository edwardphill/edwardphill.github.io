            Hello, my name is Edward Hill. I'm a Charlottesville, Virginia native living in Brooklyn, NY with my wife, Margaret and australian shepherd, Presley. I like to run, fish, and get outside as much as possible. I grew up in Virginia, went to school in Colorado, and have lived in Washington, D.C., Montana, Switzerland, and now I've lived in NYC for almost 4 years. 
        </p>
        In 2016, I started a marketplace (<a href="https://www.fisherguiding.com">Fisher Guiding</a>) to book trips online with fishing guides and captains, due to my own experience in the fishing industry. I've been working on Fisher Guiding ever since, and I'm taking this web development course to learn how to take over the management and development of the Fisher Guiding website frontend and backend. I'm excited to apply what I learn directly to Fisher Guiding.
