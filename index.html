          Hello, my name is Edward Hill. I'm a Charlottesville, Virginia native living in Brooklyn, NY with my Wife, Margaret and Australian Shepherd, Presley. I like to run, fish, and get outside as much as possible. I went to school in Colorado, and have lived in Washington, D.C. Montana, Switzerland, and now Brooklyn. 
        </p>
          In 2016, I stated a marketplace (<a href="https://www.fisherguiding.com">Fisher Guiding</a>) to book trips online with fishing guides and captains, due to my love of fishing and own expereince in the indsutry. I've been working on Fisher Guiding since, and I'm taking this web development course to learn how to take over managment and developmnet of the devlopment project. I'm excited to apply what I learned directly into Fisher Guiding.
